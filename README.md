# TransportMangement
This project is about the managingÂ the travel routes of the students from college to their residence. Here the students are not restricted to a particular bus-no, anyone can take any bus anytime.


To work on this project we proceeded using the following data structure / Algorithms / Storage Memory

    Lists	( Stops )
    Graphs ( Routes )  
    Double Linked List ( Seats )  
    Single Linked List ( User Data, Buses, Graph nodes )  
    BFS( Traversing routes )  
    Text File( Saving Users )  
    Static Memory ( Routes , Stops )  
    Dynamic Memory ( Seats Allotments )
    
Assumptions made:
1. Here the students are not restricted to a particular bus-no, anyone can take any bus, but constraints here are that bus has a constant no of seats available.

2. We assume that the routes and stops are already known to the programmer.

3. The routes are hard coded, we define the routes statically only.

Limitations / Constraints
      
      The program inputs for buses are case sensitive.
      All the fields/section are available to all the users, we allow all the function to the program user under some restrictions.
